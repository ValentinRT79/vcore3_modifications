To generate the arms:
* open the "generate vcore arms with ventermech.scad" file. 
* remove the // in front of one of the lines at the bottom
* then click the "Render" button or press the F6 key (this will take a while)
* then click "Export as STL" button or press the F7 key
* It is important to only do one line at a time, otherwise you will have to separate the bed arms in the generated STL
* Repeat for each line so that you have all 3 bed arms

6 x washers  10.5 ID x  20.0 -20.5 OD  x 1.5 - 1.6 mm . The exact thickness of these is not critical but try to get some thinnish ones. The ones Iam using are 1.4mm thick. These replace the bearing races with one placed above the bearing assembly and one placed below the bearing assembly. If the washer has a slightly curved face and a flat face, place the flat faces against the bearings.

The stack height of the two washers and the bearing plate should be around 6mm thick.
